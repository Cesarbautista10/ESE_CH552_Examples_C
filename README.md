# CH552 Examples in C

[![Coverage Status][codecov-image]][codecov-link]

This codebase provides examples for developing software in C using the SDCC compiler for the CH552 microcontroller. It serves as an excellent resource for getting started with CH552 development, offering versatility and affordability. The CH552 microcontroller is based on an 8-bit core of the 8051 architecture, with approximately 75% compatibility with the standard MCS51, making it suitable for low-cost projects.

The examples cover various functionalities including Blink, ADC, PWM, Timer, Interrupts, and bit-banging for I2C communication and controlling WS2812 LEDs.

**Note:** The examples are constantly updated to improve the development of projects at higher levels.
