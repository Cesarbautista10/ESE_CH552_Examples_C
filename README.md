# CH552 Examples in C

[![Version 1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.1-blueviolet?style=flat-square)](https://example.com/download/ch552-examples-v1.1)

This repository provides examples for developing software in C using the SDCC compiler for the CH552 microcontroller. It serves as an excellent resource for beginners and experienced developers alike, offering versatile and affordable solutions for CH552 development.

The CH552 microcontroller features an enhanced E8051 core MCU compatible with the MCS51 instruction set. With 79% of its instructions being single-byte single-cycle instructions, and an average instruction speed of 8 ~ 15 times faster than that of the standard MCS51, it is well-suited for low-cost projects.

The examples cover various functionalities including Blink, ADC, PWM, Timer, Interrupts, and bit-banging for I2C communication and controlling WS2812 LEDs.

**Note:** The examples are regularly updated to enhance project development.
